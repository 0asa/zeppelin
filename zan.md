Currently ZAN is included as a local repository in [Zeppelin package release](./download.html).

You can check what's included in ZAN from github [zan-repo](https://github.com/NFLabs/zeppelin/tree/master/zan-repo)

Also, if you're interested in writing your own Zeppelin Library, checkout [writing Zeppelin Library](/docs/development/writingzeppelinlibrary.html).

We're planning to make online, remote ZAN system in the future version.
